Insights:

I successfully transformed raw data into valuable insights, revealing noteworthy trends and patterns.

1. July is the highest revenue month: The data shows that the month of July had the highest pizza revenue. This could be attributed to various factors, such as summer vacations, holidays, or special promotions during that time.

2. Friday has the most pizza orders: The analysis indicates that Friday is the day with the highest number of pizza orders. This is likely because people often consider Friday as the start of the weekend and prefer to indulge in pizza as a treat.

3. Classic and Supreme pizzas are popular: The report reveals that customers tend to order Classic and Supreme pizzas more frequently than other pizza categories. This could be due to the popularity of these flavors, their familiarity, or effective marketing.

4. Large pizzas are preferred for value: large pizzas are the most ordered pizza size, comprising over 45% of all pizza orders. This suggests that customers find larger pizzas to offer better value for money, making them a popular choice.

By analyzing and understanding these insights, We can use the information to optimize their operations, marketing strategies, and product offerings. For example, they might consider promoting Classic and Supreme pizzas more aggressively, especially during July and on Fridays. Additionally, they could create special deals or offers for large pizzas to further boost their sales.

It's important to keep in mind that consumer preferences may change over time, so regular analysis of sales data and customer feedback is essential to stay up to date with current trends and maintain customer satisfaction.
